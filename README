 python-turing: A really, really simple Turing machine implemented in Python. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

  Eventually, I would like to get arround to adding some proper exception 
handling for errors and that sort of thing.


Directions:

  Action tables are stored in an sqlite db in a table called "action" with the
following schema:

########################
# Field Name 	# Type #
########################
# state      	# TEXT #
# symbol	# TEXT #
# state_new	# TEXT #
# symbol_new	# TEXT #
# action	# TEXT #
########################

For now, the starting state of the Turing machine tape can be declared as a
list when an instance of the Machine class is declared.


Actions:

  The simulation expects the follow strings in the action field:
    - '>' (Move tape head right)
    - '<' (Move tape head left)


States:

  Any string can be used to represent a state in the state field, but the the
string 'h' is reserved for the halt state.


Example Machine:
  You can run the example machine by executing example.py
